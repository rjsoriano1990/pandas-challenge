## Data Trends

Based on the data, I noticed a few trends throughout this project. First thing I noticed was through every query, there were way more male players than female of other/non-disclosed. Another thing I found was that players in their early to mid 20's make up the majority of players in the game. Last thing I found was that the same age group spends the most money out of every other age group in the game. These were a few trends I was able to see based on my queries through the data.
